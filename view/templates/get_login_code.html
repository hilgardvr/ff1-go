                    <b>How does it work?</b> You'll manage your own racing team and compete against other players from around the world.
                </h4>

                    Step 1: Choose a team name</br></br>
                    
                    Step 2: Assemble a team by using your budget to buy the 4 drivers that you think will do best in the upcoming race.</br></br>
                    
                    Step 3: Create or join a league with friends, colleagues and family. When creating a league you will receive a league password by email that you can share with others to join your league.</br></br>

                    Step 4: You need to select 4 drivers every race week 1 hour before qualifying starts.</br></br>
                    
                    With each race, you'll earn points equal to the points the drivers in your team earned during that race weekend(including sprint qualifying points & fastest lap points).</br></br>
